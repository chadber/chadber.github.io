<h3>My Room is My Place Where I Call Home</h3>
            
            <p>
               My room is my home. A place where I can write my thoughts, think about my goals, create and dream. I believe a home is a place where you can just be, to be free. A place that is comfortable, a place to relax. 
                   </p>

            <p>
            In the mornings I wake up, look out my window and brew my coffee. My mind wonders as I smell the fresh Sumatra blend aroma fill my room. My eyes focus as I put my glasses on. Broken images and thoughts of my next character fill my mind. A sudden flash of how I should draw my next design inspires me.
